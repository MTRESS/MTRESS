"""
Basic working 'electricity only' example.

Basic working 'electricity only' example which includes a location (house),
an electricity carrier which acts as a electricity source/supply from the 
official grid (working price of 35 ct/kWh) as well as a demand (consumer)
with a demand time series.

At first an energy system (here meta_model) is defined with a time series (index).
Afterwards a location is defined and added to the energysystem. Then the 
electricity carrier and demand (time series) are added to the energysystem. 
Finally, the energy system is optimised/solved via meta_model.solve and the 
solver output is written to an .lp file.
